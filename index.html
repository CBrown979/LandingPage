        <h2>Do You Want To Build a Community?</h2>
        <h4>Most of us only socialize with immediate family or friends.</h4>
        <p>What if we brought folks together for common unity to build a community in the neighborhoods we live in right now!</p>
        <p>Let's meet each other, become aware of our individual strengths and interests so we can ban together to collectively support each other.</p>

      <h1 id="why-anchor" a href="#">Why?</a></h1>
      <p>Many hands make light work - <em>(proverb)</em></p>
      <p>Our neighborhoods are full of people that have great solutions to problems, or have small businesses that can help the community, or have the means and desires to support those that do.</p>
      <p>Generally, in neighborhoods with people of color, our dollars bounce 1 or 2 times before leaving our neighborhoods to enrich others.</p>
      <p>What if we spent our dollars, implemented solutions and developed our neighborhood where it currently is.</p>
      <p>What if we supported the mom & pop shops instead of large corporations? Could we come together to make a better neighborhood for our families?</p>
      <p>Of course we can!</p>
      <p>This is the only way we can make real change now - we have to do it <strong>TOGETHER</strong>!</p>
      
      
      <h1 id="how-anchor" a href="#">How</a></h1>
      <p>First we need to know who each is and what we are interested in or currently working on.</p>
      <p>Please fill out the form below so we can gather some basic information about you</p>
      <p>This information will be compiled to assess topics of interests so we can create workgroups, and create a directory of local businesses, if applicable</p>
      
      <form class="Margin-base-vertical">
        <p class="input group">
          <span class="input-group-addon"><span class="icon-envelope"</span>
          <input type="text" class="form-control input-lg" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email here">
        </p>
      </form>
      
      <p>We just need the first step of leaving our homes, and meeting the people in the community to discuss the ideas we are all having.</p>
